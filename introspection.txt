1) Initial ideas: enumerate the list of crazy and not-so-crazy ideas that you initially had for your game.
 As we started thinking about the game we wanted to build, we thought about classic board/card games
 that would be fun to make into a program. We considered BlackJack, Poker, Checkers, and Dice. 
 





2)Pivots: list the spots where you changed your mind because you wanted to make something easier (or harder) on your team. Explain why.
 We changed our minds multpile times deciding what game we wanted to make. The first pivot point came at 
 ruling out Poker due to the complexity that it would entail. We also ruled out the dice because we felt that would acutally be a little
 too easy and a pretty boring game. Our decision really came down to BlackJack and Connect Four, and we decided to go with ConnectFour 
 due to the easy visualization of the playing board and just the fact that the game is fun!




3) Data structures: What data structures did you use? Why did you choose them? What alternate structures would be appropriate?
 Why didnâ€™t you choose those?
As far as Data structures go, our gameboard consists of a very simple display using for-loops and spacing. With a game as simple 
as Connect Four, there really isn't a need for storing data such as previous moves, because the moves are displayed in the game board.
For next week's assignment, there will probably be more data structures needed in order to implement an artificial player to play against.





4)Describe the hardest aspect of this assignment.
The hardest part of this assignment was getting the layout of the board game right and checking to see if somebody won( getting 4 in a row)
this took a lot of guess and check and just messing with the cout statements in order to make a neat layout that looks good.
